### This is a project i found on YouTube about a Sudoku made by FreeCodeCamp. It's interesting to me, so i actually tried and now i do some sudoku everyday

I used IntelliJ as my IDE, Java 21 as my main programming language,
JavaFX (21.0.9) as the interface e Gradle for my dependencies.

To use the program, install it with an IDE (like mine), download Java 21 and JavaFX 21.0.9, use Gradle for the dependencies (create your files with the autoproject builder and copy everything (just rewrite some path in case you need it, like in setting.gradle.kts the name of the folder)).

And i think this is it. Mabye i will improve it with some decorations, but not right now.

Again, i just take some project to learn programming, this is not mine, so for bug or explaination go to: https://github.com/BracketCove/JavaDesktopSudoku/tree/withoutgradle
